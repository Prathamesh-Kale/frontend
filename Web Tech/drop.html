    <p>O, Bhishma, O thou of mighty arms, strive without
        losing a moment. Even this is the hour fixed by the Creator of the Universe
        for success over this one'. Hearing those words uttered by the celestial

        messenger, Bhishma, filled with joy, set his heart upon Sweta's destruction.
        And beholding that foremost of car-warriors, Sweta become a combatant on
        
        foot, many mighty car-warriors (of the Pandava side) rushed unitedly (to his
        rescue). (They were) Satyaki, and Bhimasena, and Dhrishtadyumna of
        Prishata's race; and the (five) Kekaya brothers, and Dhrishtaketu and
        
        Abhimanyu of great energy. And beholding them rushing (to the rescue),
        with Drona and Salya and Kripa that hero of immeasurable soul (Bhishma)
        checked them all like the mountain resisting the force of the wind. And
        
        when all the high-souled warriors of the Pandava side were (thus) held in
        check, Sweta, taking up a sword cut off Bhishma's bow. Casting aside that
        bow, the grandsire, quickly made up his mind for Sweta's destruction,
        having heard the words of the celestial messenger. Though baffled (by
        Sweta), thy sire Devavrata then that mighty car-warrior quickly taking up
        another bow that resembled the bow of Sakra himself in splendour, stringed
        it in a moment. Then thy sire, O chief of the Bharatas, beholding that
        mighty car-warrior Sweta, though the latter was then surrounded by those
        tigers among men with Bhimasena at their head,--(thy sire) the son of
        Ganga-advanced steadily for the sake of the generalissimo Sweta alone.
        Beholding Bhishma advance, Bhimasena of great prowess pierced him with
        sixty shafts. But that mighty car-warrior, thy sire Devavrata, checking both
        Bhimasena and Abhimanyu and other car-warriors with terrible shafts,
        struck him with three straight arrows. And the grandsire of the Bharatas
        also struck Satyaki, in that combat, with a hundred arrows, and
        
        Dhrishtadyumna with twenty and the Kekaya brothers with five. And
        checking all those great bowmen with terrible arrows, thy sire Devavrata
        advanced towards Sweta alone. Then taking out an arrow resembling
        
        Death's self and capable of bearing a great strain and incapable of being
        resisted, the powerful Bhishma placed it on his bowstring. And that shaft,
        furnished with wings and duly endued with the force of the Brahma
        
        weapon, was seen by the gods and Gandharvas and Pisachas and Uragas,
        and Rakshasas. And that shaft, of splendour like that of a blazing fire,
        piercing through his coat of mail (passed through his body and) struck into
        
        the earth, with a flash like that of heaven's bolt. Like the Sun when speedily
        
        retiring to his western chambers taking along with him the rays of light,
        even thus that shaft passed out of Sweta's body, bearing away with itself his
        life. Thus slain in battle by Bhishma, we beheld that tiger among men fall
        
        down like the loosened crest of a mountain. And all the mighty car-warriors
        of the Kshatriya race belonging to the Pandava side indulged in
        lamentations. Thy sons, however, and all the Kurus, were filled with
        
        delight. Then, O king, beholding Sweta overthrown, Dussasana danced in
        joy over the field in accompaniment With the loud music of conches and
        drums. And when that great bowman was slain by Bhishma, that ornament
        
        of battle, the mighty bowmen (of the Pandava side) with Sikhandin at their
        head, trembled in fear. Then when their commander was slain, Dhananjaya,
        O king, and he of Vrishni's race, slowly withdrew the troops (for their
        nightly rest). And then, O Bharata, the withdrawal took place of both theirs
        
        and thine, while thine and theirs were frequently setting up loud roars. And
        the mighty car-warriors of the Parthas entered (their quarters) cheerlessly,
        thinking, O chastiser of foes, of that awful slaughter in single combat (of
        their commander)."
        O Vrihannala, hath spoken about thy skill in the management of steeds.
        Thou wert formerly the favourite charioteer of Arjuna, and it was with thee
        that that bull among the sons of Pandu had alone subjugated the whole
        earth. Do thou, therefore, O Vrihannala, act as the charioteer of my brother.
        (By this time) our kine have surely been driven away by the Kurus to a
        great distance. Requested by me if thou dost not act up to my words, I who
        am asking this service of thee out of affection, will give up my life!' Thus
        addressed by this friend of graceful hips, that oppressor of foes, endued
        with immeasurable prowess, went into the prince's presence. And like unto
        a she-elephant running after her young one, the princess possessed of large
        eyes followed that hero advancing with hasty steps like unto an elephant
        with rent temples. And beholding him from a distance, the prince himself
        said, 'With thee as his charioteer, Dhananjaya the son of Kunti had gratified
        Agni at the Khandava forest and subjugated the whole world! The
        Sairindhri hath spoken of thee to me. She knoweth the Pandavas. Do thou,
        therefore, O Vrihannala, hold, as thou didst, the reins of my steeds, desirous
        as I am of righting with the Kurus and rescuing my bovine wealth. Thou
        wert formerly the beloved charioteer of Arjuna and it was with thee that that
        bull among the sons of Pandu had alone subjugated the whole earth!' Thus
        addressed, Vrihannala replied unto the prince, saying, 'What ability have I
        to act as a charioteer in the field of battle? If it is song or dance of musical
        instruments or such other things, I can entertain thee therewith, but where is
        my skill for becoming a charioteer?'
        "Uttara said, 'O Vrihannala, be thou a singer or a dancer, hold thou (for the
        present), without loss of time, the reins of my excellent steeds, mounting
        upon my car!'
        "Vaisampayana continued, 'Although that oppressor of foes, the son of
        Pandu, was acquainted with everything, yet in the presence of Uttara, he
        began to make many mistakes for the sake of fun. And when he sought to
        put the coat of mail on his body by raising it upwards, the large-eyed
        maidens, beholding it, burst out into a loud laughter. And seeing him quite
        ignorant of putting on armour, Uttara himself equipped Vrihannala with a
        costly coat of mail. And casing his own person in an excellent armour of
        solar effulgence, and hoisting his standard bearing the figure of a lion, the
        prince caused Vrihannala to become his charioteer. And with Vrihannala to
        hold his reins, the hero set out, taking with him many costly bows and a
        large number of beautiful arrows. And his friend, Uttara and her maidens
        then said unto Vrihannala, 'Do thou, O Vrihannala, bring for our dolls
        (when thou comest back) various kinds of good and fine cloths after
        vanquishing the Kurus assembled for battle of whom Bhishma and Drona
        are foremost!' Thus addressed, Partha the son of Pandu, in a voice deep as
        the roar of the clouds, smilingly said unto that bevy of fair maidens. If, thus
        'Uttara can vanquish those mighty warriors in battle, I will certainly bring
        excellent and beautiful cloths.'
        "Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words, the heroic Arjuna
        urged the steeds towards the Kuru army over which floated innumerable
        flags. Just, however, as they were starting elderly dames and maidens, and
        Brahmanas of rigid vows, beholding Uttara seated on his excellent car with
        Vrihannala as charioteer and under that great banner hoisted on high,
        walked round the car to bless the hero. And the women said, 'Let the victory
        that Arjuna treading like a bull had achieved of old on the occasion of
        burning the forest of Khandava, be thine, O Vrihannala, when thou
        encounterest the Kurus today with prince Uttara.'"</p> -->
